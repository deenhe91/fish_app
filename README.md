# Overfishing Application

Overfishing is one of the biggest and most neglected issues of our time. The oceans play a crucial role in maintainig a stable atmosphere and also provide food for billions of people on earth. Maintaining a healthy ecosystem is important everywhere, but in the oceans, an unbalanced and collapsing ecosystem results in substantial effects on the levels of CO2 in our atmosphere and thus has catastrophic effects, not just for economies that rely on fishing to sustain them, but also for fish populations and ultimately for climate change.

Here I build an app that allows users to see if a particular fish is being overfished or not. Using data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.
